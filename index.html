            <h2>At first:</h2>
            <p>
                This project had me scared beyond reason. I have never coded a day in my life before this class and now all of a sudden I am supposed to be able to 
                code a whole website. Though this is a beginner coding class, I felt like I was the only one that didn’t know what was going on. I sat in class as 
                people had questions, seemed to follow along easily, and be excited for this project. I was terrified of falling behind and being that person in the class 
                that was a complete and total failure. When I realized I didn't want to be a failure, I went to the one place that had the answers to all of my questions: Google. 
                I decided that I was gonna make a website to the best of my abilities, and that it would be something I would be proud of. 
                I opened Visual Studio Code and got to work. I made sure that all of the basics were perfect and correct before I started adding in the words and the pictures. 
            </p>

                <h2>Learning & Trusting the Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Adding in the words was easy, but when it got to adding pictures, that’s when I started panicking. First, I wanted a header picture, so I went to the internet 
                    to show me how to do that. I found the picture I wanted, added it into the CSS, and refreshed the page. Nothing. It wouldn't show up. All that showed up was this 
                    gradient looking color, which confused me. It took me a week to figure out that the picture was there, it was just the very top of the picture, which is why I was 
                    seeing that blue/pink gradient. The whole picture was an image of the New York Skyline, but because the picture was just a header, it was cutting off the rest of the picture, 
                    so I was simply left with the sky. I finally figured it out by downloading a picture that was a header size, so it would fit. When I refreshed, IT WORKED and I actually screamed, 
                    called my sister, and posted it on my private snapchat story. I am not joking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also something that killed me was getting the pictures of the breakfast, lunch, and dinner to be next to each other. 
                    That definitely took a while and gave me a bit of stress when even google wasn’t helping. But, it all came together. 
                    I also got them centered (I think), and I was so happy when it came together. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also able to make the links a certain color when you hovered over them, 
                    and made sure that the pictures on each page were centered and not too big.

                <h2>What I am Proud of</h2>
                <p>
                    This is not the prettiest website, I can admit that. But, it is something I am proud of. 
                    I spent so much time taking notes and pictures from Free Code Camp when I saw something I 
                    wanted to implement into my website. It made me challenge myself to see if I could really do it. 
                    When I would refresh the page and things would work, I felt so proud of myself. I had never done 
                    anything like this, and here I am, a Business major, coding a website.

                <h2>Looking towards the Future</h2>
                <p>
                    As for things I’m excited about: everything. I took on this certificate because I wanted to 
                    distinguish myself from other Marketing majors. I never thought that I would enjoy coding or 
                    find happiness when I got something right. I loved being able to look up how to do things and 
                    not feel overwhelmed by how to do it. When I wanted to add something to my website, I looked it 
                    up, and knew that I could do that.

        <h1>Overview of Project Two</h1>
        <p>
            This project put me through the ringer at first. Nothing was working (which I later found out was because one letter was off when I linked my CSS file), and I felt like a failure. I worked so hard on trying to remake the North Face website, but had no luck. 
            I decided to start over and do something simpler. I found the Smallcakes website, and started working on that. It was so much easier to remake, but I still wonder that if I had found the mistake with the CSS before, then would I have been able to remake the NorthFace website. 
            Either way, the smallcakes website was fun and cute, so I enjoyed remaking it. At first, coding the columns and rows did not make sense to me, but after using the internet and youtube videos, I started to get the hang of it. The joy of refreshing and seeing your coding work is honestly unmatched. 
        </p>
    <h2>Panel One</h2> 
    <p>
        Once I started working on the smallcakes website, everything was much simpler. 
        It was basically a bootstrap website, so it was easy to use the Bootstrap docs and remake the website. 
        I liked how I could see the website, and know what to look up to remake it. 
        The inspect tab really helped to find fonts and specific colors, and I also liked how I can now 
        understand the Inspect page of websites. I think this panel (and whole project) showed me how much I have learned.
